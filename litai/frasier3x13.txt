No one ever does. Trust me on this. When I was separated from your mother, there was this pretty coroner in the city morgue. I guess I always had a little crush on her. Any time we found a dead body I'd jump in and say, "Okay, boys, I'll take it from here." So, one night I down to the corner bar.

NILES 
Coroners have their own bars?

MARTIN 
No, corner, Niles. The corner. Anyway, we had a few drinks, the lights were low, Sinatra was on the juke box- suddenly it all started pouring out. I told her how I felt. I knew the second it was out of my mouth it was a mistake. She let me down easy, but we still had to go on seeing each other all the time and it was very uncomfortable. Sure wasn't any fun going to the morgue after that.

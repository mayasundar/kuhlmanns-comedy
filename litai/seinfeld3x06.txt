ACT ONE
SCENE A
INT. ESCALATOR - GOING DOWN TO A GARAGE. IN SINGLE FILE: GEORGE, JERRY AND ELAINE, WHO'S CARRYING A PLASTIC BAG WITH GOLDFISH, AND KRAMER WHO'S HAVING A ROUGH TIME WITH A LARGE, HEAVY BOX.

GEORGE
One left...What a joke.

KRAMER 
You can have this one.

GEORGE
No, that's not enough BTUs for my
living room...That was a complete waste of time.

ELAINE
Hey, I didn't get one either.

JERRY
Why do I always have the feeling that
everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?

ELAINE 
This is what people do.

JERRY
No they don't. They're out on some big
picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.

THEY GET OFF THE ESCALATOR AND HEAD FOR THE CAR.

Liz holds the wedding dress up to herself in the mirror on the back of her office door. It is gorgeous. She thinks about trying it on. Just then Jack bursts in, disheveled and frantic. Liz quickly hides the dress.

JACK
I'm in crisis mode, Lemon. I've already sold twenty million dollars in ad time for "SeinfeldVision." Now Jerry's trying to pull the plug. It's alright. I thrive in crisis mode. It brings out the best in me. And the fact that I have not one idea of how to solve this only energizes me more. I was up all night brainstorming.

Jack flips through a yellow legal pad he's clearly been writing on a lot.

JACK (CONT'D)
Number one: kill Seinfeld. Number two: kill Seinfeld, then kill myself. Number three: kill Seinfeld, flee to Svenborgia--

LIZ
Jack, I'm not having the best day either--

He flips several pages in.

JACK
Number seventy: you seduce Seinfeld. 

LIZ
Why is me seducing Seinfeld all the way at seventy?

JACK
Seventy-one: I fake a hurricane so all regular programming gets canceled.

LIZ
These are terrible ideas.

JACK (snapping at her)
There are no bad ideas in brainstorming!
(collects himself)
It's all right. Something'll come to me in the eleventh hour.
(manically laughing)
It always does, Donaghy! You devil!

Jack exits as abruptly as he entered.

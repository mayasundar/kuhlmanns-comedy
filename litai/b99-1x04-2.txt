INT. HOLT'S OFFICE - LATER (D3)

Holt works at his desk. Amy enters, holding a framed painting to her chest.

AMY 
Knock knock.

HOLT
You can knock with your hands. Saying it is ridiculous.

AMY
Okay, well, I know that you're having a bad day...

He stares at her, blank-faced.

AMY (CONT'D)
...I think you're having a bad day. So to cheer you up, I had Terry do this painting, to replace the photo you hated.

She turns the painting around, revealing a beautiful OIL PORTRAIT of Holt. He looks somber and dignified.

HOLT
I threw away the photo because I think it's ostentatious to hang pictures of yourself, especially when you haven't earned a place on the wall.

AMY 
Ah.

HOLT
But you would have me hang a baroque oil painting of myself, like I'm a North Korean dictator. No ornate gold frame? And why am I not astride a noble steed, clad in armor?

AMY (lost)
We can add a horse!

INT. BULLPEN - BACK TO SCENE (D2)

AMY
I'm telling you-- he and I have a
connection, and there is something bothering him. Can you help me out?

Terry nods. Amy beckons to SUE, the eyewitness.

AMY (CONT'D)
Ma'am, can you describe the perp to
Sergeant Jeffords, please?

SUE
He had dark, curly hair, a neck tattoo--

TERRY
Wait slow down. Start with the eyes.
Were they desperate? Lonely? Did they betray heartache?

SUE
Um, they were brown.

He tosses the pencil on the table.

TERRY
Do you even want your purse back?

Amy rolls her eyes: this is gonna take forever.

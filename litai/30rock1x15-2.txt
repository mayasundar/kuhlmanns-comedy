EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - CONTINUOUS

TRACY
You're the only one I can trust, K.
You're my whole entourage now.

KENNETH
I'm not so sure I can handle that.

TRACY
Yes, you can. Because you were honest with me. I don't need a couple of "yes men". I need the truth.

KENNETH
Well, if that's the case then I should tell you that you're never going to dunk that basketball. Also, that Oscar you have is made of chocolate. And that lady you European-kissed last night was actually a gentleman--

TRACY
Okay, Kenneth, that's enough!

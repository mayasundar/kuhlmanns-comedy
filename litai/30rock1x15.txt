ACT ONE
FADE IN:
INT. MAXIM PHOTO SHOOT SET - DAY

A downtown photography studio. A PHOTOGRAPHER and ASSISTANTS are setting up around a sleek leather couch. MILE, a thirtyish hipster, oversees everything. LIZ stands next to JENNA, who's wearing a robe.

LIZ
This is such an honor. I'm friends with number four on "Maxim's" list of the sexiest women in comedy.

JENNA
At first I was mad that Marge Simpson beat me, but then I saw the photos: hot.

An assistant takes Jenna's robe, revealing a sexy outfit. Liz reacts. The assistant starts oiling up Jenna.

LIZ
Ew, Jenna, what is that smell?

JENNA
Oh, that's the body oil. It doesn't smell great but it makes my skin glow. It's really expensive -- there's some horse semen in it!

Well, pretend you weren't so superficial and you actually managed to pull off a long term relationship. What would you do to keep things hot?

ROZ
Well, once I had a boyfriend take me out to a bar and we pretended we were strangers picking each other up. That was kind of hot.

FRASIER
So you used fantasy and role playing.

ROZ
Yeah, it was so much fun we tried it again, only that time he went home with someone else.

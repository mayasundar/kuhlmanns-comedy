============================================

This project uses the artifact of Quirinus Kuhlmann's Love-Kiss XLI as inspiration for a similar permutation of fragmented comedy scripts.
I used the Python library nlpaug to augment words in each line at random, which takes the effect of swapping words
(and punctuation marks) rather than deleting/permanently altering them.

I break from a recent trend in manipulating scripts (and attempting to recreate them) with Markov chains & RNNs, instead loosely breaking from
Kuhlmann's permutative patterns in an attempt to create similarly absurd lines in a sitcom script. I found that permutations, as expected,
weakened the tightly-woven structure of a television sitcom by creating confusion rather than humor, ensuring the fragments are difficult
to decipher (much like Love-Kiss XLI).

The prototype is published at https://mayasundar.github.io/kuhlmanns-comedy/. Press "next" to wander through my Kuhlmann-inspired 
augmentation and permutation experiments!
